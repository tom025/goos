# Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests

I'm currently reading the goos book. I am a big fan of the style of development
demonstrated in the book.

I am a ruby developer with a limited knowledge of Java so I decided to follow the
examples in jRuby.

Run tests by `jruby -S rspec spec`

Any feedback or advise would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
